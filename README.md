# Rainbow_Cats_Universal_FPS_Aimbot_Experiment_Only
An experiment of auto-aim mechanic for all FPS games using neural network and AI humanoid posture recognition. Experiment and discussion of anti-cheat only.

<b>First Note:</b>

- I personally hate hackers in games and will seriously fight against all kinds of cheats in games.

- This is only an exploration of how AI could ruin modern FPS games and the methods to fight against it. 

- Therefore, I only released part of the code. Main.py is made private. 

- You will only see the basic functionalities such as mouse input, screen capture and AI posture estimation. 

- I'm not responsible for any consequences cause by modifying or rewriting the code.

- All Experiments are done with bots. It was never used in official matches.

<b>Insights:</b>

- As neural network and AI is evolving, the technology of face recognition becomes better over time, which also provides new methods to cheat in FPS games.

- Different from traditional cheats which fetch the information from servers, this AI-based cheat does not use any of the internal game data.

- Similar to how the players play the game, it just looks at the computer screen and clicks on the detected head position, which makes it almost impossible to be detected.

- Currently, it seems that encrypting or hiding the mouse data could be one way to fight against this cheat.

<b>Results:</b>

- The results are terrifying. The aimbot can handle all kinds of humanoid bodies in FPS games.

- The accuracy is high. Although sometimes it will miss a few shots, but this is inevitably a concerning problem if the model is well-trained.
