# Rainbow_Cats_Universal_FPS_Aimbot_Experiment_Only
An experiment of auto aim mechanic for all FPS games using neural network and AI humanoid recognition, Experiment and discussion of anti-cheat only.

First Note: 

- I personally hate hackers in games and will seriously fight against all kinds of cheats in games.

- This is only an exploration of how AI could ruin modern FPS games and the methods to fight against it. 

- Therefore, I only released part of the code. Main.py is made private. 

- You will only see the basic functionalities such as mouse input, screen capture and AI posture estimation. 

- I'm not responsible for any consequences cause by modifying or rewriting the code.

- All Experiments are done with bots. It has never been used in official matches.
