# Rainbow_Cats_Universal_FPS_Aimbot_Experiment_Only
An experiment of auto aim mechanic for all FPS games using AI humanoid posture recognition. (Experiment and discussion only)

First Note: 
I personally hate hackers in games and will seriously fight against all kinds of cheats in games. This is only an exploration of how AI could ruin modern FPS games and the methods to fight against it. Therefore, I only released part of the code. Main.py is hidden. You will only see the basic functionalities such as mouse input, screen capture and AI posture estimation. I'm not responsible for any consequences cause by modifying or rewriting the code.
